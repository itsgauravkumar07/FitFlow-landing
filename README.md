## About
Landing page for FitFlow — a fitness coaching service. Includes:
- Hero (headline, subtext, CTA)
- Features (3 items)
- Testimonials
- Pricing + Contact
- Footer

## How I used Vercel v0
I used Vercel v0 to prototype the UI sections (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing and Footer). The layout and initial HTML/CSS were generated with v0 prompts, then I rewrote and refactored each section into clean Next.js/TypeScript components and applied Tailwind for styling and responsiveness.
